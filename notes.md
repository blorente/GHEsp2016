# BeBanjo

- TMM fred brooks -> No silver bullet
- CI? Tools for CI? Release cycle?
- Technical debt with CI?

## Process:
- Issues as user stories? Everthing is an issue.
	- Every part of the converstaion is __written__
	- Issue is where the conversation happens? And then it transates to the PR. The PR needs to have a summary of possible issues and 
changes. PR tiene que tener una lista de __ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA__

## CD:

- Releases every day or so.
- Always favor things closer to release. Favor working on PRs over new issues for example. Even with urgent new bugs.
- Estimation: If a task is going to take more than a week, __you don't know how long it'll be__. And you probably need to slit that.
